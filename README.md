# Arbitrage Detection System

**Stop missing profitable trades while bots get rich.**

This system detects cross-DEX arbitrage opportunities in real-time and alerts you before they disappear. Built with Drosera framework for maximum speed and reliability.

## Why This Exists

Every day, thousands of profitable arbitrage opportunities appear across DeFi protocols. Price differences between Uniswap and SushiSwap, temporary imbalances during high volatility, cross-chain price gaps - all pure profit waiting to be captured.

The problem? By the time you manually spot these opportunities, they're gone. MEV bots extract millions daily from the same price differences you're looking for.

This system levels the playing field by automating the detection and giving you the speed advantage you need.

## How It Works

The system continuously monitors price differences across DEXes and validates opportunities through multiple safety checks:

- Price gaps must exceed minimum thresholds
- Sufficient liquidity must exist for meaningful trades  
- Profit must exceed gas costs and slippage
- Opportunities must persist across multiple blocks (filters MEV traps)
- Reserve ratios must allow successful execution

Only when all conditions pass does it trigger an alert, ensuring you only get notified about genuinely profitable trades.

## What You Get

**ArbitrageDetectorTrap.sol** - The core monitoring system that watches DEX prices and validates opportunities

**ArbitrageResponse.sol** - Handles alerts and tracks your performance over time

**Complete test suite** - Proves the system works with comprehensive testing scenarios

**Mock DEX environment** - Test everything safely before risking real funds

## Core Features

- Mock DEX monitoring simulates cross-DEX price differences for testing
- Safety validation prevents MEV traps and unprofitable trades with 5 built-in conditions
- Gas cost calculation ensures simulated trades remain profitable after fees
- Persistence checking filters out fake opportunities that only exist for one block
- Opportunity logging records detected arbitrage scenarios (not actual trading performance)
- Configurable thresholds adjust detection sensitivity for different market conditions

## Getting Started

Deploy the contracts to testnet first and run the test suite to understand how it works. The system includes mock DEXes so you can simulate arbitrage opportunities and verify detection works correctly.

Once you're comfortable with the mechanics, configure it for mainnet with real DEX integration and start capturing profits that bots are currently taking.

## Technical Requirements

- Solidity ^0.8.20
- Foundry for testing and deployment
- Drosera framework integration
- Basic understanding of DEX mechanics and arbitrage trading

## Performance Expectations

The system is designed for speed and accuracy. Detection happens within seconds of price changes, and the five safety conditions eliminate false positives that waste gas and time.

Your success depends on execution speed after receiving alerts, capital allocation, and market volatility. Higher volatility creates more opportunities but also more competition.

## Risk Warning

**This is experimental software dealing with financial markets.**

Smart contracts can have bugs. Markets can move against you. MEV bots might still front-run your trades. Network congestion can make profitable trades unprofitable.

Start small, test thoroughly, and never risk more than you can afford to lose. Arbitrage trading requires skill, speed, and capital - the detection system gives you information, not guaranteed profits.

## Disclaimer

This is a Proof of Concept(PoC) built with Drosera framework. Deploy on testnets first to validate functionality before considering mainnet use.
